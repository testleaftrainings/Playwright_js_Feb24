Abstraction-hiding the implementation
            -extact
            -ideas
            -Reasearch field
            -Mobile -->Internal working of any feature in a mobile 
            -House 

            -->generating ideas /know the thing what requires 
                  -->how to acheive it we dono

            Interface -->as like a class but it give you 100% abstraction
            Abstract class-->0 to 100% abstraction

            Hiding the complex behaviour of an application and showing relavant information to the user

            Abstract class -->0 to 100%
              ->partially built house
              ->complete design(Method without logic) and implementation (Method with logic)


To implement abstract class 

abstract class tesReporter
 abstract start();

 abstract class extends another abstract class
 class extends abstract class

Interface -->100% abstraction 
             -->completely design (without have any logic)
          interface extends other interface
          class implements interface
          abstract class implements interface
PageObjectModel:
---------------
 3 folders
   Pages -->create methods respect to the pages
   tests -->execution based on test function
   utils -->creating wrapper methods
   
Utils folder-->create ts file
try and catch the exception
 try -->actual script to be executed-->if any exception
   catch-->exception will be catched -->reported 
     -->will not resolve issue 
     -->helps to continue the execution
     -->throw --> custom exception created by the user to stop the execution in catch block

pages -->implement respective methods

LoginPage -->doLogin-->login functionality
HomePage-->clikOnApplauncher -->extends LoginPage






to run in debug
Add breakpoints in line of codes
run the command from terminal
npx playwright test filename.spec.ts  --debug
